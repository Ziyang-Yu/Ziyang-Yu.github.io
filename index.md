## About Me

Welcome! I’m Ziyang Yu, a master student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Waterloo. Before this, I obtained my B.S. degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Southern University of Science and Technology.

My research encompasses Large Language Models, and Graph Neural Networks. I hold a strong academic background and have contributed to multiple research projects, constantly pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in the machine learning field.

## Research Interests

- **Graph Neural Networks:** Distributed training of GNN.
- **Applied Large Language Models:** LLM for Biology, LLM for Network.
