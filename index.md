## About Me

Welcome! I'm Ziyang Yu, a senior machine learning engineer at Alibaba Group. Before this, I obtained my M.Eng degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of Waterloo.

My research encompasses Large Language Models, and Graph Neural Networks. I hold a strong academic background and have contributed to multiple research projects, constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the machine learning field.

I am open to potential positions in the China/Canada/United States, including internships and full-time roles. If you're interested in collaborating or discussing opportunities, please feel free to reach out.

## Research Interests

- **Graph Neural Networks:** Distributed training of GNN.
- **Applied Large Language Models:** LLM for Biology, LLM for Network.
